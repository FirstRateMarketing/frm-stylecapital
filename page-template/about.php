                <h2>Style Capital was founded by me, Lisa Lennkh, and named after the two industries I know the most about. I’ve spent the last 30 years of my career in either finance or fashion… quite often both!</h2>
                <p>With years of experience working in investment banks and hedge funds on three continents, working for Elle magazine, consulting for fashion brands, styling clients for brands at fashion week, and writing an award winning fashion blog, I believe in using style strategically, to create impact, authority, and connection at work and in life.  </p>

                    <h3>Money</h3>
                    <p>I don’t want anyone to waste one cent on the wrong clothes. Even if you are buying a sweatshirt, it should be in a colour that makes you look great. Most people only wear 20% of what they own, and 80% just takes up space in their closet. </p>

                    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
                    <p>I’ve been an environmentalist since birth. The clothing industry is the 2nd largest polluter on the planet, after big oil. The average US consumer throws away 81.5 pounds (37 kilos) of clothes per year. 80% of discarded clothing goes to landfill or is incinerated. Our planet cannot afford for us to be trial and error with our wardrobes. Knowing your colour palette and having a style strategy can eliminate this for you. </p>

                    <h3>Empowerment</h3>
                    <p>If you wear a wardrobe in your palette, people notice YOU, not just your clothes. You are in harmony, like a piece of art in the right frame. Although black can be practical in the corporate world, my role as your style strategist is to make sure that you do not waste all of your one wild and precious life in black if there are other colours that are incredible on you. </p>
