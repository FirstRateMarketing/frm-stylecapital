            <h1>Every company and every industry has it own dress codes.</h1>
            <p>Law firm codes are different from banks, which are different from hedge funds or tech startups. Your office and your industry have a context; you need to dress within the parameters of that context in order to succeed, but you still need to be you.</p>

                    <p>I appreciate that being yourself vs being an employee is a fine line to navigate, but I’ve spent decades doing it. I know how to amplify you and develop your unique style to give you presence and authority, no matter what industry you work in. </p>

            <p>I offer bespoke group or one to one styling events for women’s networks, for internal team building exercises, for external client events, for women returners, for women switching to entirely different job sectors that require very different wardrobes, and for those who simply need more polish after being promoted to bigger roles.</p>
            <p>I course-correct graduate trainees or people early in their careers who haven’t ‘understood the corporate dressing assignment’ and haven’t made the transition from student/festival dressing to a corporate yet still true-to-themselves wardrobe. Early in your career, you want the judgements that are made about you to be accurate and helpful, to be built on your abilities and your personality. Do not undermine yourself or distract from your capabilities by thoughtless non-strategic dressing every morning.</p>
