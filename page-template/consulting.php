                        <h3>Founder Blindness</h3>
                        <p>Like artists who mostly paint in their seasonal palette without being aware of it, founders of brands often create clothing in their personal palette. If the founder is a Winter, he or she is likely to create collections in an almost entirely Winter palette… which is fine if you are in France where most people are Winters.</p>
                        <p>But what if you want to sell to the UK, whose population is predominantly Autumn? What if you are investing in a brand to franchise abroad? You won’t have repeat customers if they look drained and tired because you’ve not taken their colour palette into consideration. Subtle changes, like offering cream as well as white, camel as well as grey, and chocolate as well as black will ensure you have a clientele who looks fabulous in your clothes.</p>
